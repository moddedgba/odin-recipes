        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>3 pounds of baby back pork ribs</li>
            <li>1 cup of barbecue sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a gas grill for high heat or arrange charcoal briquetets on one side of the barbecue. Lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Combine cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small jar. Close the lid and shake to mix.</li>
            <li>Trim the membrane sheath from the back of each rack. Run a small knife, between the membrane and each rib, and snipp off as much membrane as possible.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle as much of the rub unto both sides of the ribs as desired.</li>
            <li>Place aluminum foil on the lower rack to capture drippings and prevent flare-ups. Lay the ribs on the top rack of the grill, away from the coals. Reduce gas heat to low and close the lid. Cook until meat pulls away easily from the bone, about an hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Brush the ribs with barbecue sauce and grill for an additional 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Serve the ribs.</li>
        </ol>
